-   However, it is still not verified what the cause of PCOS is.

| 02 Clean data                                         | 03 Augment data                                                    |
+=======================================================+====================================================================+
| -   Fixing random cells and replacing them with NA    | -   Unit changes ( inch to cm)                                     |
| -   Rename & factorizing columns                      | -   Rounding BMI                                                   |
| -   Split data frame into body and blood measurements | -   Grouping & BMI                                                 |
|                                                       | -   Change Blood type and cycles from numeric values to characters |
|                                                       | -   Create new column for cycle/ pregnancy stage                   |
|                                                       | -   Merging data frame into one file                               |
